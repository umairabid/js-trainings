## Javascript Training - Part 1 

### Welcome to Training

#### Introduction

Considering the increasing use of javascript in different platforms, there are very slim chances that any developer working in mobile, web or server side will avoid javasrcript completely. Most probably in near future you will work in some javascript powered stack. 

We at Tkxel believe that any good developer should at least be able to understand and extend any javascript related codebase which is the original motivation behind this training.

#### Targeted Audience

Anyone who has worked in at least one OOP based programming language and keen to learn javascript

#### Pre Requisites

Forget everything you know about programming and prevent your mind to relate javascript concepts with the languages you usually work in

### Introduction to Javascript

Before we actually start coding and see the practical usage of javascript its very important to learn some core concepts of javascript to build a strong foundation. Let's start with discussing some basics

1.  What is Javascript?    
2.  Where does it run?
3.  How does it run?
4.  Javascript Event Loop
5.  What is ECMAScript
6.  Javascript flavors

#### What is Javascript

Javascript is

-   Multiparadigm: Allows you to write your programs in different paradigms like functional, object oriented and event oriented which is similar to PHP, C++ and different from Java
    
-   Dynamic: Does stuff like memory allocation on run time similar to PHP, Python, Ruby etc
    
-   Weakly Typed: Not a surprise if we are talking about a dynamically typed language

Syntax: Well, look it up  

#### Where does it run?

Unlike many programming languages, Javascript doesn’t have any standard stand alone compiler or interpreter where you can run your javascript code (true for at least in practice). It always runs in some sort of containers which can be divided in two parts

1.  Javascript Engine
2.  Javascript Runtime environment

Javascript engine is responsible for interpreting your code into executable commands and the runtime environment is responsible for creating the container specific objects which then can be used in javascript code and the built in javascript objects (more on this later).

#### How does it run?

As stated earlier, there is no standalone interpreter for javascript it, is used in containers which defines in which context javascript will be used. One example of container is Chrome, which uses javascript engine V8 with chrome’s runtime environment. The runtime environment is responsible for creating objects like `document` and `window`. That means when you attempt to manipulate `DOM` through `document` or listen to scroll events through `window` you are not basically using a javascript constructs instead you are using something which is provided by runtime environment of chrome. As a result you won't be able to use those objects in some other container which doesn't create them for you. In addition to environment related objects, runtime is also responsible for creating built in js objects. 

The javascript engine is pretty simple entity it does not have built in functionality nor does it deal with path resolution for modules etc, since it does not have any interface to do it. All it has to do is to turn your code in executable commands and that is it.  Javascript Engine has three important parts

1.  Execution Stack
2.  Queue and
3.  Memory Heap

Execution stack holds the context for currently executed code, queue contains a list of code/functions/blocks which will be executed next and heap is where everything is stored i.e. built in objects, current context variables, globals etc. This can be seen visually in the following image

It is very important to note that there is no single Javascript engine used in every container, it is up to the container to either implements its own engine or use an existing one. For example Chrome create V8 engine which is now also being used by Opera and Node whereas Firefox also created its own engine "SpiderMonkey". 

#### The Event Loop

Event loop is essentially a property of "Queue", of Javascript Engine, which is to keep listening to new events and execute them as soon as there is one. Indeed, a very simple thing but holds a very special significance in javascript environment. The stack in js engine runs in synchronous or blocking way i.e. it will only execute the next instruction once the current one is completed. Now this can be a problem in Javascript containers like Node which runs in only one process, to illustrate this consider the following example.

Node handles all the requests in single process as oppose to languages to PHP which handles each request in its own process. Now, PHP is also synchronous but its not really a problem since request will be handled in its own process, so if some user send a request involving some heavy time intensive processing it won't have any impact on other requests. However, if we apply the same scenario in Node, the stack will be stuck at processing one request and Node won't be able to handle any other request.

Let's consider one more example in context of browser. Suppose you implement a synchronous ajax request, since this will also block the stack of javascript engine, browser won't be able to initiate any other operation until the request is completed, operations like triggering events, scrolling, re rendering etc. To resolve this synchronous associated problems javascript environments use events loops to implement non blocking intensive operations. Lets take the example of blocking and non blocking ajax requests to understand the concept. First lets consider the example of blocking request

```js
//send request and store the response in res
var res = sendBlockingRequest(url)
if (res.error == null) {
  // do something with res
} else {
  throw res.error
}
foo()
```
In this example we are using a function `sendBlockingRequest` provided by run time environment to make blocking requests, which accepts one parameter `url`. When the requests initiates the stack gets blocked at this function and then not only the code which depends on result of the request has to wait but other execution like call to function `foo` also gets blocked. Not to mention, not just the `foo` will need to wait, nothing else will work in that browser window as well. Now let's look at a non blocking way of doing stuff

```js
//send request
sendNonBlockingRequest(url, function(res) {
  if(res.error == null) {
	// do something with error
  } else {
	throw res.error
  }
})
foo()
```
This time we are using a non blocking or async function `sendNonBlockingRequest` to send requests. This function accepts two parameters one is `url` and the second one is `function` or in other words a block of code which you want to execute after the request is completed. The way this works is, when you call the async function the run time environment will send the request but won't block the execution. It will wait for the request to complete and then push the block of code which you passed as function, to queue and it will execute on its turn. It will not block any thing, the function `foo` will get called right after you initiate the request and browser operations will also continue to work. 

By the way the function which gets pushed on queue is widely known as callback function because you don't call that function directly, you pass it to some other function which will call it back for you once it needs to be called.

#### What is ECMAScript

By now we know that there is no single implementation of JavaScript engines.
We also know that runtime environments does not only create the objects used in that specific environment but also the default built in objects of javascript as well. Does that mean that we need to be aware from the stuff which one javascript environment provides and stuff which it does not? Well, to some extent it does but that extent is quite intuitive since you can't expect Node to have document and window objects and likewise you can't expect browsers to have apis to read files from user system. Apart from that and the rest of the implementation specially the implementation of built in functions is standardized by ECMA meaning that whichever container you are using if it adheres to ECMA standards you can expect javascript and built in javascript functions to behave very similarly. Since javascript is standardized by ECMA it is sometimes also called ECMAScript

#### Javascript flavors 

With the rise of javascript different organizations and open source communities created their own flavors of javascript to add more functionality on top of javascript or to make it look like some other technology they are working with. For example ruby community created `CoffeeScript` which resembles a lot like ruby. One of the most famous flavor is `TypeScript` which adds type checking. Flavors provide transpilers which convert the flavored code into javascript code.
